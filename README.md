[Musa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_(genus)) is a lean bootstrapper for any libp2p-based network. It's called like that to capture the [üçå](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_(genus)) vibes [around here](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/8958).

## Background

The current bootstrappers run by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai) are
instances of [Kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo) and one other [written in Rust](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/tree/master/misc/server) [[blog post](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-rust-libp2p-based-ipfs-bootstrap-node/)].
It is good to have implementation diversity in case of a regression that could
render the network unreachable. We have already [shipped a feature](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/8856)
that uses previously identified peers as backup bootstrap peers. However, it
will take time until peers will upgrade their Kubo installation and therefore
won't benefit from that feature for a while. With Musa we're adding to the effort
of diversifying the fleet of bootstrap peers.

Because of the way it is built, it can be configured to bootstrap into any
libp2p-based network. Further, we expect it to require minimal resources

## Usage

Just run

```sh
$ go run *.go
```

in the root directory of this repository.

### Tracing

To enable tracing, first start the [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) container:

```shell
docker run --rm --name jaeger -p 16686:16686 -p 4317:4317 jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.49
```

Then provide the `--trace-host` and `--trace-port` command line flags:

```sh
$ go run *.go --trace-host localhost --trace-port 4317
```

Traces will be available at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686).

## Configuration

There are plenty of configuration options. Just provide the `--help` command line flag
